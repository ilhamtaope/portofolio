        <p>
          I completed my education at the
          <a href="https://umm.ac.id/"> University of Muhammadiyah Malang </a>
          from 2017 to 2021. During this time, I earned a Bachelor's Degree in
          Electrical Engineering and Informatics. My academic journey provided
          me with a strong foundation in various technical disciplines,
          including web programming, object-oriented programming, and
          algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my formal education, I had the privilege of being part
          of international student projects, which expanded my perspectives and
          enhanced my experiences. I was honored to be an Awardee of
          International Student Exchange at the University of Minho 2021,
          Portugal. I also received the prestigious Awardee of International
          Student Leadership from Polytechnic of Singapore in 2019.
